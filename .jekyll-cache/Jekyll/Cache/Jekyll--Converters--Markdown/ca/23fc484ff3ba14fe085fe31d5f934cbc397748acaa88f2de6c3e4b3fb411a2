I"Ã<p>I probably shouldâ€™ve done this a long time ago and itâ€™s only recently, where I found the courage to stop being a hoarder and decided to share.</p>

<p><strong>Let me explain.</strong></p>

<p>Most designers (probably most people even) have a stash of visuals they find on the internet to browse through later. Some are public, so everyone can see, but I imagine most have a private stash too. Maybe itâ€™s just me but I can also imagine most people with these private stashes keep â€˜em very close to their heart and desktop. That folder thus becomes a composite of your taste, it becomes highly personal which becomes practically un-shareable.</p>

<p>I was trying to figure out why I was so reluctant to share and Iâ€™ve come up with several reasons.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Itâ€™s deeply personal <em>(itâ€™s like someone browsing through your computer)</em></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> You get to judge me <em>(Iâ€™m showing you my behind the scenes, not my highlight reel)</em></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> You wonâ€™t appreciate it because the download took you 2 mins but the gathering took years of constantly sourcing, depositing, and withdrawing from my visual memory bank</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Scared of losing ideas</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Scared that everything I ever made was probably a copy of a copy of a copy which makes me question my own creativity and originality <em>(This is where Impostor Syndrome kicks you square in the fucking face.)</em></p>

<p>So for what itâ€™s worth, this is my inspiration collection since 2009. It includes tumblr-babes, embarrassing screenshots, snippets of silly memes that i thought were funny at the time and saved, file dumps I needed to do to clean my desktop and whatever else. Anyways this sharing thing is more about me letting go, and Iâ€™m curious how itâ€™ll affect me after this post. If at all.</p>
