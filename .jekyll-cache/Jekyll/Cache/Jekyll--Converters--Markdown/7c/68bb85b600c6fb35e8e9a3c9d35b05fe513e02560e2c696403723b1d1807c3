I"Ã<p>Look, I never write. And I <em>especially</em> never write about design. Not only because Iâ€™m not a particularly good writer as youâ€™ll see, but also cause there are too many other designers better than me and more respected than me who write better things than me. But through a gentle request via Twitter, I thought Iâ€™d give it a shot. Also cause I really like the article and I felt honored to be named amongst that group of designers.</p>
