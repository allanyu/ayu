<p><em>(Full disclosure: I showed this post to a friend of mine and he quickly showed me Vsco Cam which does something similarâ€¦didnâ€™t mean to do that)</em></p>

<p>Instagram, I love your product and I did expect a lot of UI growth from you with this new update and I was more than disappointed. I know your new push was to focus on the photo-taking experience, but the filter selection is a major aspect of that experience and it seems like you guys forgot it this time around.</p>

<p>Your filter selection UI is incredibly annoying, I hate it. I also hate the names, what the hell is a â€œWaldenâ€?</p>

<p>Youâ€™re probably referencing this:</p>

<p>But I wish you were referencing this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/postsimg/instagram/2_walden.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I see that youâ€™ve made the filter icons bigger in this update so people can see the effects more but bro, whatâ€™s the difference between these two when youâ€™re looking at it on the phone? The effects youâ€™re portraying is way too subtle here.</p>

<p><img src="/images/postsimg/instagram/3_name.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The actual difference is pretty drastic.</p>

<p><img src="/images/postsimg/instagram/4_difference.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And maybe the effect just depends on the individual picture and I get that. But the point is, your filter names and the effect icons doesnâ€™t mean anything when it comes to the actual effect of the picture itself.</p>

<p>The physical aspect of selecting the filters is sort of a pain here too. I donâ€™t want to tap on each filter to browse through them. I mean I think itâ€™s okay but there may be a better option:</p>

<p>Each filter is actually an individual element that is overlaid on top of the original image.</p>

<p><img src="/images/postsimg/instagram/5_filter.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>This creates a physical reference to actual lenses being swapped in and out. The filter can be changed by swiping left and right instead of tapping on a particular icon. Besides everyone knows swiping feels better than tapping.</p>

<p>Now when Iâ€™m in my filter selection flow, I generally go through each and every single filter <em>(except the B&amp;W cause everyone knows thatâ€™s for chumps)</em> making a mental note of the filter I might want to come back to after Iâ€™ve explored all my filter options. But by the time Iâ€™ve gone through all my choices and want to test out the 2 or 3 filter options Iâ€™ve picked out, Iâ€™ve already forgotten the filter names.</p>

<p><strong>â€œShit was it Rise, or Hudson?â€</strong></p>

<p><strong>â€œWas it Nashville or Valencia?â€</strong></p>

<p>I can never remember the names of them when I go back cause I donâ€™t want to use that extra headspace. Iâ€™m lazy and I donâ€™t want to think about your filter names when Iâ€™m already over exhausting my mental capacity to pick a filter for my photo. Now to solve this, you can just use numbers. You have 19 filters (including Normal). Now when I find a filter I like, instead of taking a mental note of â€œEarlybirdâ€ I can say â€10â€.</p>

<p><strong>â€œRemember 4 and 10â€</strong></p>

<p>I think thatâ€™s a lot easier.</p>

<p><img src="/images/postsimg/instagram/7_revise.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So the flow here would be something like this:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Take photo <br />
<strong>2.</strong> Start swiping <br />
<strong>3.</strong> Keep mental note of a filterâ€™s number <br />
<strong>4.</strong> Keep swiping until you finished browsing all filters <br />
<strong>5.</strong> Use the bottom row for quick access to the filters <br />
<strong>6.</strong> ??? <br />
<strong>7.</strong> Profit</p>

<p>Look, I donâ€™t know what you guys are up to over there and for all I know you guys probably tried this and hated it.</p>

<p>And maybe thereâ€™s a reason for using filter names and icons, maybe it makes the person feel more artistic when theyâ€™re creating it. I donâ€™t know. But Iâ€™m just saying, you guys can do something more amazing with the UI and I hope you do in the future.</p>
